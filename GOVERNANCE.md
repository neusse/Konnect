# How Konnect is run

One page, so nobody has to reconstruct this from issue threads.

## Maintainers

- **[@mixelpixx](https://github.com/mixelpixx)** — project owner. Decides
  scope, releases, licensing, and anything not settled below.
- **[@neusse](https://github.com/neusse)** — maintainer. Owns the areas listed
  in [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS).

Konnect is deliberately built and reviewed through **two different AI
toolchains** — Claude Code on one side, OpenAI Codex on the other. That is not
duplication to be tidied away. Every defect found so far in the agent-facing
guidance Konnect ships was found from *outside* the toolchain that ships it,
because a reviewer inside it cannot see its blind spots. Keep the two stacks
independent.

## Merging

- **A green PR may be merged by its author.** No approval is required. CI is
  the gate: `main` requires all ten checks to pass, and that requirement is not
  waived for anyone with write access.
- **Merge commits only** (`gh pr merge N --merge`), so authorship survives.
- **Run the full local gate after each merge** before landing the next one:

  ```
  cargo fmt --all -- --check
  cargo clippy --workspace --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
  cargo test --workspace --locked --lib --tests
  cargo test --workspace --locked --doc
  ```

  Capture the exit code directly. Piping into `tail` or `echo` swallows it, and
  that has put a red commit on `main` twice.
- **CODEOWNERS is a routing hint, not a veto.** It auto-requests the right
  reviewer; it does not block a merge.

## Claiming work

The queue is only legible if claims are visible.

- **Assign the issue to yourself** when you take it, and add `claimed`. A claim
  written only in a comment is invisible to everyone not reading that thread.
- Design-first on the issue for anything non-trivial: agree the approach, then
  open one focused PR.
- Priority labels `P0`/`P1`/`P2` and `area:*` labels are how the queue is read
  at a glance. Keep them current.

## Branches and the PR queue

The detailed contributor workflow is in
[docs/BRANCH_AND_PULL_REQUEST_WORKFLOW.md](docs/BRANCH_AND_PULL_REQUEST_WORKFLOW.md).
Maintainers apply these queue rules:

- Independent changes use independent branches from current `main`.
- Contribution branches start from the latest `main`, not a release tag, except
  for an explicitly requested release-line backport.
- A dependent series exposes one mergeable step at a time. Deeper work stays in
  the contributor's fork or remains draft against an agreed upstream base; it
  must not appear as several ready, cumulative PRs against an unchanged `main`.
- After a prerequisite merges, the author reconstructs the next PR from current
  `main` with only its unique commits. A previous green run on a cumulative head
  is obsolete.
- A PR with copied prerequisites, a stale base, or unresolved conflicts is not
  ready for final review. Maintainers may return it to draft and request a clean
  reconstruction rather than repeatedly resolving contributor branch history.
- A short-lived `integration/<topic>` branch requires maintainer agreement on
  scope, ownership, synchronization, evidence, terminal issue closure, and an
  expiry. Child PRs receive focused review and CI before one final integration PR
  is merged to `main`. Unrelated work continues on `main`.

These rules protect review quality without requiring every related change to be
one large PR. The unit of review remains one focused outcome.

## Releases

- **Never hand-edit tool counts.** `cargo xtask fix-doc-counts` rewrites them
  all from `router/registry.rs`. Hand-editing is what made every tool-adding PR
  conflict with every other one.
- **Announce intent before bumping**, and **land count-changing PRs first.**
  Every PR that adds a tool touches the same handful of documented counts, so a
  release that moves those counts conflicts with the entire open queue at once.
  This is not hypothetical: v0.10.0 did it to eleven open PRs.
- Version choice: a new tool, a renamed tool, or a changed response shape is a
  **minor**. Fixes — even ones that narrow behaviour nobody could have relied
  on — are a **patch**.
- Release notes state behaviour changes **and** known limitations. A reader who
  sees "fixed" and stops checking has been failed by the notes.
- The pre-release gate is CI, the real-KiCad E2E workflow, the live IPC tests,
  and an end-to-end benchmark run against the candidate. The benchmark has
  twice found what CI could not; it is a step, not a nicety.

## Evidence

The house rule, and the reason most of this file exists:

- **A response field must be derived from the result, never echoed from the
  request.** Most defects in this project's history are that one mistake.
- **A check that could not run is `BLOCKED`, never a silent pass.**
- **Fixtures come from real KiCad output.** A hand-authored fixture tends to
  share the assumption the code got wrong, so it agrees with the bug.
- **Neuter every new guard** and confirm the test catches it. A passing test
  proves nothing until you have watched it fail.

## Licensing

Konnect is AGPL-3.0 with commercial licences available, so contributions must
be relicensable. Submitting a contribution accepts the CLA in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). If you cannot agree to it, open an issue
describing the change instead — a reimplementation from a description is fine.
