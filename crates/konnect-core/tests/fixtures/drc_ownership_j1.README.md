# DRC ownership fixture (issue #413)

`drc_ownership_j1.kicad_pcb` and `drc_ownership_j1.drc.json` are the board and
report pair used to prove that a DRC report item names what owns it.

## Provenance — read this before trusting a byte of it

The board is KiCad-reserialized; the committed report combines a real KiCad DRC
report with clearly marked parser-only edge cases. The split matters, so it is
spelled out exactly.

### KiCad-authored, verbatim

Everything except the additions listed below is byte-identical to the board and
report `ncolomer` pasted inline in a comment on
[mixelpixx/Konnect#413](https://github.com/mixelpixx/Konnect/issues/413) (no
file was attached; the bytes are in the comment's `j1-repro.kicad_pcb` and
`raw_kicad_cli_drc.json` code blocks), produced on Konnect 0.10.0 / KiCad
10.0.5 / macOS 26.6.2 arm64 with:

```text
kicad-cli pcb drc --format json --severity-all --output raw_kicad_cli_drc.json j1-repro.kicad_pcb
```

The reporter states that the `(footprint …)` block was copied byte-for-byte
from a real board (only two absolute `model` paths redacted), so the J1
footprint, its four `Edge.Cuts` `fp_circle` nodes, its four pads, and every
UUID in them are KiCad's own. That is the load-bearing evidence for this
issue: it shows KiCad **does** emit the nested footprint-graphic UUID
(`7b970478-1e4a-48b6-b01a-35348027ca5e` and its three siblings), so the
`copper_edge_clearance` items can be resolved by exact UUID with no guessing.

The report's `source` field still reads `j1-repro.kicad_pcb` — the reporter's
filename — because the surrounding bytes were left untouched. `date` and
`kicad_version` are likewise the reporter's.

### Board-owned acceptance geometry

The board-owned outline and unrelated graphic were initially added to the
reporter's minimal board, then the complete board was force-resaved by KiCad
10.0.6 on Windows with:

```text
kicad-cli pcb upgrade --force drc_ownership_j1.kicad_pcb
```

The committed `.kicad_pcb` is therefore KiCad's serialization, not a
hand-authored format approximation. The synthetic-looking UUIDs are retained so
the acceptance items remain obvious.

Added to the board, as top-level children of `(kicad_pcb …)`:

- four `Edge.Cuts` `gr_line` segments forming a `(120, 56.5)`–`(160, 100)`
  rectangle, UUIDs `e0000000-0000-4000-8000-00000000000{1,2,3,4}` — the board's
  own outline, so the fixture has a `owner.kind: "board"` `Edge.Cuts` item
  standing beside J1's footprint-owned ones;
- one `F.SilkS` `gr_line` from `(125, 60)` to `(135, 60)`, UUID
  `50000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001` — the unrelated board graphic.

### Parser-only report cases

The last two entries of the committed `.drc.json` were deliberately constructed
because a current KiCad run cannot naturally report a missing or unknown UUID:

- a `silk_edge_clearance` warning naming the outline segment
  `e0000000-…-000000000004` and the silkscreen segment
  `50000000-…-000000000001`, i.e. two board-owned items;
- a `copper_edge_clearance` error whose first item carries **no** `uuid` at all
  and whose second carries `ffffffff-ffff-4fff-8fff-ffffffffffff`, a UUID that
  appears nowhere in the board. These two items exist only to exercise
  `ownership_status: "uuid_missing"` and `ownership_status: "not_found"`.

No `kicad-cli` run produced those two report violations. They are parser-only
fixtures and are not evidence of what KiCad emits. The live ignored test runs
DRC against the KiCad-reserialized board and supplies the independent real-tool
path.

## What the pair covers

| acceptance case (#413)                | fixture item                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| board's top-level `Edge.Cuts` outline | `gr_line` `e0000000-…-000000000004`, `owner.kind: board`   |
| `Edge.Cuts` circle nested in J1       | `fp_circle` `7b970478-…`, `owner.kind: footprint`, ref J1  |
| a pad belonging to J1                 | `pad` `5bc25fc3-…`, `owner.kind: footprint`, ref J1        |
| an unrelated board graphic            | `gr_line` `50000000-…-000000000001` on `F.SilkS`           |
| a report item with no UUID            | first item of the last violation, `uuid_missing`           |
| a report item with an unknown UUID    | `ffffffff-ffff-4fff-8fff-ffffffffffff`, `not_found`        |

Footprint ownership does not make a finding false. J1's `Edge.Cuts` circles are
still fabrication geometry — real cutouts at footprint-relative positions.
Ownership tells a caller which remedy applies: moving J1 moves the pad and the
cutout together and cannot change their mutual clearance, so the footprint
definition or the rule is what needs review.

## Tests using this fixture

- `crates/konnect-core/src/tools/cli.rs`, module `drc_ownership_tests` — parses
  the committed pair and asserts the ownership of every item. No `kicad-cli`.
- `crates/konnect-core/src/tools/cli.rs`,
  `run_drc_enriches_items_from_the_board_it_ran_on` — `#[ignore]`d, needs a real
  `kicad-cli` on PATH. Copies the board to a temp directory, runs the real
  `pcb drc`, and asserts ownership on whatever KiCad reports that run. It does
  not compare against the committed JSON.
